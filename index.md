## Biography

Hi! My name is Takeshiro. And it's not my real name, it would suck if I exposed my real name.
I'm a 16 y.o that likes to watch Anime and also loves Android.


### About me.

As you all know, I like Android. I'm also a RevengeOS Maintainer. Xiaomi Mi A1 is the device
I'm maintaining. I was a Corvus OS Contributor but left the team after a few long months.
After that, I joined Revenge OS and so far, it's awesome!

I also maintain PitchBlack Recovery Project which is an awesome TWRP-based recovery btw.

I also watch tons of animes on my free-free time (If you know what I mean).
My top 5 Anime is:
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
Hunter X Hunter
Death Note
Attack on Titan
Fate Series (Fate/stay night to be specific)
